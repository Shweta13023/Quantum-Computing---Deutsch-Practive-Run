"Quantum Computing - Deutsch Algorithm Practice"

This repository provides a hands-on implementation of the Deutsch algorithm using quantum computing principles. It is designed as a practical introduction to quantum algorithms and quantum computing frameworks, such as Qiskit.

üìò Project Overview

Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to solve certain computational problems more efficiently than classical computers. One of the foundational quantum algorithms is the Deutsch algorithm, which demonstrates the power of quantum parallelism.

The Deutsch algorithm is a quantum solution to the problem of determining whether a given function f(x) is constant or balanced with just one evaluation. This outperforms classical computing, where at least two evaluations are needed to solve the same problem.

What you'll learn:

Quantum gates and circuits: Understand how quantum gates such as the Hadamard gate work to create superposition and entanglement.

Quantum parallelism: Leverage the unique property of quantum states to evaluate multiple inputs simultaneously.

Qiskit: Learn how to simulate and execute quantum circuits using the open-source Qiskit framework.

‚ú® Algorithm Explanation

The Deutsch algorithm solves a simple computational problem: given a binary function f(x) where x ‚àà {0, 1}, determine if the function is:

Constant: Returns the same value for all inputs (either always 0 or always 1).

Balanced: Returns 0 for one input and 1 for the other.

In classical computing, you would need to evaluate f(0) and f(1) separately to determine whether the function is constant or balanced. In contrast, the Deutsch algorithm achieves this with just one evaluation using quantum superposition.

Steps in the Algorithm:

Initialization: Prepare two qubits in the state |0‚ü©.

Apply Hadamard gates: Create superposition across all inputs to evaluate both f(0) and f(1) at the same time.

Oracle application: An oracle is a quantum black box that computes f(x) and applies the corresponding transformation to the qubits.

Final Hadamard transformation: Another Hadamard gate is applied to interfere the states, so the result reveals whether f(x) is constant or balanced.

Measurement: The measurement will tell us if the function is constant or balanced based on the interference patterns.

The key insight is that the quantum version of the problem allows us to solve it with a single query to the oracle, demonstrating quantum parallelism.

üìä Visualizing Quantum Circuits
One of the strengths of using Qiskit is the ability to visualize quantum circuits. In this notebook, you will:

Create quantum circuits: See the gates applied to the qubits at each step.
Simulate the quantum circuit: Run the circuit on a classical simulator.
Plot results: Visualize the probability distribution of the qubit states.

‚öôÔ∏è Running the Algorithm
Once you have set up the environment, you can run the notebook and simulate the quantum algorithm. Follow these steps:

Understand the Circuit: The notebook will guide you through constructing the quantum circuit.

Simulate the Result: Use Qiskit‚Äôs Aer simulator to run the quantum circuit.

Measure the Output: Measure the final state of the qubits to determine whether f(x) is constant or balanced.

Example output could look like this (depending on the function f(x)):

If f(x) is constant: You will measure the state |0‚ü©.
If f(x) is balanced: You will measure the state |1‚ü©.
